# Polymer: the interoperability rollup

:::info Landing page
On the docs landing page we'll give an short mission statment for Polymer, as well as an overview of the documentation content and how to navigate it.
:::

- Contextualization
    - Why interoperability
    - Why Polymer
        - IBC
        - Rollup-centric roadmap (Ethereum)
- Concepts
    - IBC
        - "vanilla" IBC
        - IBC client diversity
        - (multi-hop?)
        - IBC for the modular world
    - vIBC
    - Architecture (start from OP stack?)
    - Further reading
        - Refer to references list: Ethereum, OP stack, IBC, modular thesis etc.
- Build 
    - Developer workflow
    - interoperable dApps (EVM focus)
        - vIBC smart contracts
        - IBC Application interface in Solidity
        - (Future possibility of adding other VMs / languages)
    - Quickstart tutorials:
        - Dummy example sending string
        - More realistic use case (looking into ReFi example with carbon credits)
- Tooling
    - Block explorer
    - Wenwei test framework
- Run Infra (runbooks):
    - Devnet (potentially later, not for POC/testnet)
    - Testnet
    - Mainnet
