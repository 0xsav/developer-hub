# Polymer: the Ethereum interoperability hub

Polymer is Ethereum's interoperability hub, connecting Ethereum's Layer 2's using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol](https://ibcprotocol.dev).

Welcome to the developer hub for Polymer! We're excited to collaborate with you on building the future of interoperability together!

<!-- Depending on what leads the reader here, we could add Polymer features. But there's a chance that info is duplicated on the developer hub homepage, i.e. polymerlabs.org/developers -->

Here's a quick overview of our documentation:

:::note Navigate your way through the docs.

- **[The interoperability problem](./category/why-polymer/)**

    **What?** This section provides the context around the interoperability space, why it's an important issue to tackle and why the current landscape offers opportunity for Polymer to fill a need.

    **For whom?** Essentially everyone, but in particular founders, product teams that need interoperability solutions and researchers who are researching the space.

- **[Concepts](./category/concepts)**

    **What?** This section goes more in-depth on the concepts making up the Polymer protocol. IBC, virtual IBC as well as the stack to build the Polymer L2 are handled.

    **For whom?** Developers who need a refresher on the conceptual underpinnings for their development work + protocol analysts doing research on or looking to integrate Polymer.

- **[Build](./category/build)**

    **What?** This section explains how to build IBC-enabled Solidity smart contracts and how to find the vIBC core contracts deployed by Polymer that relayers listen to.

    **For whom?** For cross-chain developers using Polymer as interop solution.

- **[Run infra](./category/run-infrastructure)**

    **What?** Section that outlines how to run (parts of) the infrastructure required, either for local development or in testnet or mainnet environments (when applicable).

    **For whom?** Infrastructure operators or developers who want to spin up the stack locally to expedite their development.
