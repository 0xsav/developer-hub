# Polymer: the interoperability hub rollup

The Polymer rollup is Ethereum's interoperability hub, introducing the Ethereum community to [Inter-Blockchain Communication](https://ibcprotocol.dev).

We welcome you to the developer hub for Polymer and are excited to see that you're willing to find out more or even to collaborate on building the future of interoperability together!

<!-- Depending on what leads the reader here, we could add Polymer features. But there's a chance that info is duplicated on the developer hub homepage, i.e. polymerlabs.org/developers -->

To make your journey through our documentation a pleasant one, let's give a quick overview of the different sections and who they're targeted at.

:::note Navigate your way through the docs.

- **[The interoperability problem](./category/why-polymer/)**

    **What?** This section provides the context around the interoperability space, why it's an important issue to tackle and why the current landscape offers opportunity for Polymer to fill a need.

    **For whom?** Essentially everyone, but in particular founders, product teams that need interoperability solutions and researchers who are researching the space.

- **[Concepts](./category/concepts)**

    **What?** This section goes more in-depth on the concepts making up the Polymer protocol. IBC, virtual IBC as well as the stack to build the Polymer L2 are handled.

    **For whom?** Developers who need a refresher on the conceptual underpinnings for their development work + protocol analysts doing research on or looking to integrate Polymer.

- **[Build](./category/build)**

    **What?** This section explains how to build IBC-enabled Solidity smart contracts and how to find the vIBC core contracts deployed by Polymer that relayers listen to.

    **For whom?** For cross-chain developers using Polymer as interop solution.

- **[Run infra](./category/run-infrastructure)**

    **What?** Section that outlines how to run (parts of) the infrastructure required, either for local development or in testnet or mainnet environments (when applicable).

    **For whom?** Infrastructure operators or developers who want to spin up the stack locally to expedite their development.
