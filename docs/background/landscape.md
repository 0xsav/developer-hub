# The (state layer) interoperability landscape

:::danger Placeholder

Eshita is doing some research and writing a piece about this, will update with result.

:::

The transport layer is the uniquely defining layer of interoperability protocols. At a high level, there’s the IBC transport standard that Polymer implements and there’s incompatible alt-transports that competitors implement. Most of these alt-transports cannot even be considered a transport standard as they do not enforce TAO logic, do not have a specification and are highly simplistic. Since alt-transports are incompatible with the IBC network and lack standardization, we’ll review the interoperability landscape from the lens of the state layer.

## Centralized bridges

These are also known as proof of authority bridges. These are a fixed group of private keys that have the authority to attest to bridged state from one chain to another. When there’s no open participation model, the bridge can only be considered to be centralized. The obvious downsides of this approach is that the private keys used in the signing process are prime targets for hacks. Centralized bridges can migrate to a multi-signature bridge by allowing for open participation for signers.

## Multi-signature bridges

Multi-signature bridges can be a proof of stake validator network or a decentralized oracle network. The key here is that there is some dynamic group of signers that can change over time.There is also usually some economic value that’s staked and can be slashed upon misbehavior to guarantee the security of the bridge. The downside of centralized bridges still applies here but the attack vector now also comes in the form of economic attacks to gain control of the bridge. Additionally, a major issue with relying on a few observers of a chain to attest to state is that the local view of the observers is likely not consistent with the view of a chain with a large validator set such as Ethereum. This is true for both centralized and multi-signature bridges.

## Light client bridges

Light client bridges rely on the verification of a consensus proof generated by a chain. Each counterparty chain verifies the consensus proof of the other to establish a state layer connection. IBC has started off using light clients to bridge state between chains. Light client bridges are more secure than centralized and multi-signature bridges but are more expensive to verify. Since clients are verifying the consensus of a chain but not the execution, this approach has an honest majority assumption security wise.

## Optimistic bridges

Optimistic bridging in its strongest form involves the destination chain being able to verify fraud proofs produced by the source chain. This is execution verification instead of consensus verification. Bridging from optimistic rollups to Ethereum follows this model. There’s also a weaker form of optimistic bridging that involves a sharded economic security model that relies on a relayer staking a slashable bond on the source chain but this is much weaker security wise. Optimistic bridges generally have good security that increases with the fraud proof window. The amount of capital & resources an attacker would need to spend to censor a fraud proof increases with the size of the fraud proof window. There is also an honest minority assumption or a 1-of-N assumption security wise.

## ZK bridges

Zero knowledge bridging in its strongest form involves the destination chain being able to verify execution proofs produced by the source chain. This is also execution verification instead of consensus verification. Bridging from zero knowledge rollups to Ethereum follows this model. The most common form of zero knowledge bridging in interoperability is converting consensus proofs into zero knowledge (zk) consensus proofs. Using zk consensus proofs is as good as light client bridges with respect to security but weaker than optimistic bridges. There is an honest majority assumption with consensus proofs zk or not.

## Canonical bridges

Canonical bridges are run by the team building an L1 or L2 and sanctioned by the team to move liquidity in and out of their ecosystem. can be any of the above in a fully decentralized setting. However, many canonical bridge implementations are highly centralized. They generally consist of some centralized set of private keys that are authorized to bridge state from one chain to the next. In the long term, we may see canonical bridges start moving over to more secure forms of state layer bridging.
